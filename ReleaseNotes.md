> **Version 44 is a Technical migration release: DO NOT USE release 44 until an explicit note that it has been stabilized.**
>
> Version 44 uses the most current Vaadin 24, which has several major changes.  Vaadin has switched to a newer and much cleaner JavaScript toolkit (LitElement) so the major difference is that all the scoreboards, timers and decision displays have to be migrated.
