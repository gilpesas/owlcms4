41.x Scoreboard Styling Improvements, User interface improvements.

*Alpha release. For experimentation and feedback only. Features may change without notice.*

- 41.0.0-alpha00: Enhanced the HTML page structure for the scoreboards to support more advanced formatting.
- 41.0.0-alpha00: Redid the CSS styling for the current athlete bottom banner.  It no longer restricts the length of the words in the bottom row.
- 41.0.0-alpha00: the variable OWLCMS_STYLESDIR indicates what directory contains the style sheets.  The default value is "styles". This makes it easier to create and test alternate visual styles.
- 41.0.0-alpha00: Reorganized the buttons on the Display Selection and Video Streaming pages to be more logical

##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- New session scoreboard for current rankings
- A new Records Management page has been added, reachable from the preparation page.
  - Record definition files can be uploaded interactively 
  - The ordering of the records on the scoreboard is no longer dependent on the file names, and is edited interactively.
- The "Athlete Challenge" situation is now displayed and supported by the MQTT messages and the jury device.
- We now recommend using [fly.io](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Fly) as the cloud installation is straightforward and owlcms can be run for free. Heroku is now deprecated as they have broken the easy install method and are no longer free.
- The editing page used for athlete registration and weigh-in has been redone to be more readable and better organized.
- The jury members can now vote again during a deliberation break. The decision lights are reset when deliberation starts so the post-video vote is a secret vote. 
- A new site section has been added to start the displays used for video streaming (see the [streaming documentation](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/OBS?id=_2-setup-owlcms-with-some-data)). The video-oriented scoreboards have a different header with the event name and group description, and show different columns (by default, the same as used by IWF).
