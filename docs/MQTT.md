## MQTT Server

MQTT is used for communication between refereeing, jury and timekeeper devices built using Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi and other device controllers.

owlcms now includes an MQTT server to support these exchanges, so the only software required is for the devices.

Several projects that use MQTT for communication between devices and owlcms include:

- Arduino/Firmata projects: the following projects are based on widely-used Arduino boards, but could actually run on any board that supports the Firmata protocol
  The two projects below provide software that connect owlcms to the devices.

  - [owlcms/blue-owl: Technical Official device integration for OWLCMS (github.com)](https://github.com/owlcms/blue-owl)  This project is an extension of the one below by Scott Gonzalez targeted at persons interested in building their own devices. It contains a `build-it-yourself` section with diagrams, firmware and even instructions for simulating the device.  An interactive program for running the devices and connecting them to owlcms is provided. 
  - [scottgonzalez/blue-owl: Technical Official device integration for OWLCMS (github.com)](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/blue-owl) is the originator of the Firmata integration with owlcms.  This software is expected to be the basis of commercial devices, but is freely licensed.

- ESP32 projects

  - https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms-esp32 contains Arduino code and simple circuit schematics to build a simple refereeing device with an indicator LED and a buzzer to remind a referee to enter a decision.  

  - https://github.com/kingbutter/owlcms4-ref-m5stack-core2 uses the M5Stack devices as a basis for touchscreen-based refereeing devices.


See [MQTT Messages](MQTTMessages) for details on how MQTT is used.



### Configuration of the embedded MQTT server

By default, owlcms will start an MQTT server in anonymous mode. If there is no username,  any process can connect to the owlcms machine on port 1883 using any username and any password.

If you have a wired network with no wifi you might be comfortable doing that, but we do suggest that you add a  username and password.

The simplest way of doing this is using the user interface.  The values you set in these fields are the values you will use from your MQTT device controllers.

> These fields were previously used to configure how owlcms connected to an external server such as Mosquitto or aedes.  *They no longer control the external server.*  If you need to connect to an external server, you will need to use the [Using an External MQTT Server](#using-an-external-mqtt-server) method described at the end of this page



## Configuration Variables for the embedded MQTT Server

If you configure the MQTT Server in the database, the settings are valid when that database is in use.

If you want something more permanent you can use either environment variables or Java system properties.

On Windows, you can do as follows

1. Go to the installation directory, and locate the `owlcms.l4j.ini` file (depending on your Windows configuration, the `.ini` extension can be hidden).  
2. The following three properties can be defined -- they play the same role as the fields in the database.

```bash
# MQTT for refereeing devices
-DmqttUserName=owlcms
-DmqttPassword=some_Password_you_choose
-DmqttPort=1883
```

> NOTE that the variable `mqttServer` is NOT defined (see the next section)

3. You can also use the three equivalent environment variables OWLCMS_MQTTUSERNAME, OWLCMS_MQTTPASSWORD and OWLCMS_MQTTPORT



## Using an External MQTT Server

> As soon as you define -DmqttServer or define the OWLCMS_MQTTSERVER environment variable the built-in server is not used.

The Heroku and Fly.io don't allow for the owlcms server to also provide the MQTT.  For these situations, define the environment variable OWLCMS_MQTTSERVER in addition to the other (OWLCMS_MQTTUSERNAME, OWLCMS_MQTTPASSWORD and OWLCMS_MQTTPORT).  Then owlcms will use the external server instead of its built-in server. 

As an example to use a free HiveMQ account ([see here](https://console.cloudmq.cloud)), you would define the config variables on Heroku, and secrets on fly.io to contain something like the following (obviously, use your own values)

| Variable            | Value                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OWLCMS_MQTTSERVER   | 44341a3e47cc48d2b260b8064120f2df.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud          |
| OWLCMS_MQTTPORT     | 8883 (external servers require a TLS connection, owlcms will use TLS if the port starts with 8) |
| OWLCMS_MQTTUSERNAME | your_username (one of the user names you created using the Credentials page) |
| OWLCMS_MQTTPASSWORD | some_Password_you_choose (the associated password)           |

For testing, you might want a local owlcms to connect to a remote MQTT.  This can also be done using -D system property definitions instead of variables. The example then becomes.

```bash
-DmqttServer=44341a3e47cc48d2b260b8064120f2df.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud
-DmqttUserName=your_username
-DmqttPassword=some_Password_you_choose
-DmqttPort=8883
```
