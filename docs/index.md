# owlcms: Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 

> **The full-range solution for running competitions**
>
> This free application is a *fully-compliant* weightlifting competition management system that has been used worldwide to manage many large-scale championships. 
>
> **Simple and automatic**
>
> The program computes lifting order automatically, and automatically sets the clock correctly.  It also enforces the rules for weight changes (time remaining, moving down).  The announcer always sees the lifting order, and is informed of all the changes, and is shown what weight is required on the bar.
>
> It is actually simple enough that you can run a small club meet with just a single laptop, or a regional meet with only everyday electronics (a couple of laptops and TVs, some phones).
