39. 0 Records Management

- 39.0.0-alpha01: fix for records management page not showing up when updating an existing database
- 39.0 Changes
  - 39.0.0:  A new Records Management page has been added
    - Record definition files can be uploaded interactively 
      - Uploading a file again replaces the previous upload of the same file.
      - If files are found in `local/records`, they will be loaded on startup as they were before, replacing what you might have uploaded.  To avoid confusion, we suggest you remove files from local/records.
    - The ordering of the records on the scoreboard is no longer dependent on the file names, and is edited interactively.


##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- Athlete challenge is now displayed and supported by the MQTT jury device.
- We now recommend using [fly.io](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Fly) as the cloud installation is straightforward and owlcms can be run for free. Heroku is now deprecated as they have broken the easy install method and are no longer free.
- The editing page used for athlete registration and weigh-in has been redone to be more readable and better organized.
- The jury members can now vote again during a deliberation break. The decision lights are reset when deliberation starts so the post-video vote is a secret vote. 
- A new site section has been added to start the displays used for video streaming (see the [streaming documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/OBS?id=_2-setup-owlcms-with-some-data)). The video-oriented scoreboards have a different header with the event name and group description, and show different columns (by default, the same as used by IWF).
