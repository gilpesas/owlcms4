40.0 Video Streaming Scoreboards

- 40.0 Changes

  - Added scoreboard to show athletes in ranking order, to be used for public display or video streaming
  - CSS Styling
    - The use of @import has been removed from the css files.  The page templates now do the inclusions explicitly.
  
    - The scoreboards will no longer show a scrollbar.  This enables using more of the page when there are large groups, or if bigger fonts are wanted.
    - Added an option to disable the autoversioning suffixes added to static files. This allows browser development tools to edit the css files.  See the [Styling](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Styling) documentation for details.
  - Fix: Before start of Clean and Jerk, order of snatch leaders shown at bottom of scoreboard was random.
  - Fix: missing 2nd marshal and 2nd technical controller on protocol sheets.
  

##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- A new Records Management page has been added, reachable from the preparation page.
  - Record definition files can be uploaded interactively 
  - The ordering of the records on the scoreboard is no longer dependent on the file names, and is edited interactively.
- The "Athlete Challenge" situation is now displayed and supported by the MQTT messages and the jury device.
- We now recommend using [fly.io](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Fly) as the cloud installation is straightforward and owlcms can be run for free. Heroku is now deprecated as they have broken the easy install method and are no longer free.
- The editing page used for athlete registration and weigh-in has been redone to be more readable and better organized.
- The jury members can now vote again during a deliberation break. The decision lights are reset when deliberation starts so the post-video vote is a secret vote. 
- A new site section has been added to start the displays used for video streaming (see the [streaming documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/OBS?id=_2-setup-owlcms-with-some-data)). The video-oriented scoreboards have a different header with the event name and group description, and show different columns (by default, the same as used by IWF).
