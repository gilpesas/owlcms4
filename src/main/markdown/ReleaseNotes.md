40.0 Scoreboards

- 40.0 Changes

  - 40.0.0-alpha00 Added scoreboard to show athletes in the ranking order for their registration category (instead of start number). This is meant to be used for public display or video streaming.
  - CSS Styling
    - The use of @import has been removed from the css files.  The page templates now do the inclusions explicitly.
  
    - The scoreboards will no longer show a scrollbar. This allows a bit more flexibility when zooming in or enlarging the fonts.
    - Added an option to disable the "autoversioning" suffixes added when fetching static files like css and images. This is necessary when using browser development tools to edit the css files.  See the [Styling](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Styling) documentation for details.
  - Fix: Before start of Clean and Jerk, order of snatch leaders shown at bottom of scoreboard was random.
  - Fix: Added 2nd marshal and 2nd technical controller on protocol sheets.
  

##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- A new Records Management page has been added, reachable from the preparation page.
  - Record definition files can be uploaded interactively 
  - The ordering of the records on the scoreboard is no longer dependent on the file names, and is edited interactively.
- The "Athlete Challenge" situation is now displayed and supported by the MQTT messages and the jury device.
- We now recommend using [fly.io](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Fly) as the cloud installation is straightforward and owlcms can be run for free. Heroku is now deprecated as they have broken the easy install method and are no longer free.
- The editing page used for athlete registration and weigh-in has been redone to be more readable and better organized.
- The jury members can now vote again during a deliberation break. The decision lights are reset when deliberation starts so the post-video vote is a secret vote. 
- A new site section has been added to start the displays used for video streaming (see the [streaming documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/OBS?id=_2-setup-owlcms-with-some-data)). The video-oriented scoreboards have a different header with the event name and group description, and show different columns (by default, the same as used by IWF).
