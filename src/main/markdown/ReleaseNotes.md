40.0 Scoreboard improvements and fixes, fixes to small report issues, MQTT fixes.

- 40.1 Changes
  - Database Snapshot on-demand
    - Added a  `competition/export` HTTP endpoint to obtain a JSON export of the database.  The requesting party must be listed in the backdoor access list on the "Language and System Settings/Access Control" page.
    - Added new [MQTT Messages](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/MQTTMessages#subscribed-by-external-observers) for field of play events: ` liftingOrderUpdated`, `startLifting`, `break`, and `ceremony`.  Together with the already existing `fop` messages, these enable an external observer to determine when to grab a JSON export (as opposed to polling blindly).
  - fly.io cloud installation notes were adjusted to include installing the control interface locally; there are intermittent issues with their beta web-based interface.
  - The database idle connection timeout for fly.io is set to 60s to match their recommended settings

##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- New session scoreboard for current rankings
- A new Records Management page has been added, reachable from the preparation page.
  - Record definition files can be uploaded interactively 
  - The ordering of the records on the scoreboard is no longer dependent on the file names, and is edited interactively.
- The "Athlete Challenge" situation is now displayed and supported by the MQTT messages and the jury device.
- We now recommend using [fly.io](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Fly) as the cloud installation is straightforward and owlcms can be run for free. Heroku is now deprecated as they have broken the easy install method and are no longer free.
- The editing page used for athlete registration and weigh-in has been redone to be more readable and better organized.
- The jury members can now vote again during a deliberation break. The decision lights are reset when deliberation starts so the post-video vote is a secret vote. 
- A new site section has been added to start the displays used for video streaming (see the [streaming documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/OBS?id=_2-setup-owlcms-with-some-data)). The video-oriented scoreboards have a different header with the event name and group description, and show different columns (by default, the same as used by IWF).
