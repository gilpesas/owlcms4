37.6.0  Separate styles for video feed displays

- 37.6 Enhancements
  - Separate site section to launch displays used for video streaming. The video displays now have their own style sheets. 
    - The video-specific style sheets are in the `local/styles/video`. By default the color scheme is the same as the site pages, with slight differences in the content shown (matches the columns used on IWF broadcasts). A Web Designer (or a motivated person) can use the [Style Customization](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Styles) instructions to change the colors, what columns are visible, to include logos, etc.
  - A current "video group" and "video category" can be set for medals and ranking pages. If medals for group F1 are being awarded during the warmup of group H1, the current group is H1, but the current "video group" needs to be F1. The "video category" can be set when there are several categories in a group and it is desired to show them one by one.  
    - The video group and category settings are currently taken into account when the video page is refreshed.
- 37.6 Fixes
  - Restored the publicresults remote scoreboard capability.
  

##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- The announcer and marshal screens show the 6 attempts and total for each athlete. ([#525](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/issues/525))
- Migration to the most recent version of the Vaadin user interface framework. The navigation (menu, top menu bar) has been redone to use officially supported components.
- There is now a separate page for pre-competition documents. There are now separate documents for each purpose instead of multiple tabs. See [Pre-Competition Documents Documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/2400PreCompetitionDocuments).
- Customization of team points. Templates for the final results package now have an extra tab that contains the points awarded for each rank. Copy and rename the template if you need to change the point system for a given competition.
- Capability to add flags and athlete pictures on the attempt board (#508).  See [Flags and Pictures](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/FlagsPicture) documentation.
- Improvements to Records eligibility. See [Records Eligibility](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Records) documentation. 
- New Weigh-in template to create an empty Weigh-in Summary (used to facilitate data entry)
- New Sinclair coefficients for the 2024 Olympiad.  An option on the Competition rules page allows using the previous (2020 Olympiad) values if your local rules require them.  Masters SMF and SMHF use the 2020 Olympiad values until further notice.
